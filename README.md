=====

This is a library based on https://github.com/slymarbo/rss. It is a fork with backwards incompatible changes and fixes to the original repo.

## Changes

- Changes to the `Feed` struct, removing unread flags and more
- Changes to feed parsing, for compatibility reasons
- ... And more. This README was written a long time after this fork was created. So feel free to check the history

## Fixes

- Charset decoding. Be a lot more lenient than standard Go towards faulty or broken encodings
